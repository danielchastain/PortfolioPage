# Portfolio Page
This is my portfolio page. This website, includes Bootstrap, Particles.Js, Javascript, HTML, Node.JS, and Express JS. In total I've put about 20-30 hours of work into this site and very proud how it came out. Things I was unsure about the project is that I didn't want my website to be flashy or gimmicky while including technologies I find exciting to implement. Also make want to start documenting more of my jouney into the tech world, and will also serve as my blog. 

Future Build Plans: Make the cards expand as I come out with more, implement a blog.
